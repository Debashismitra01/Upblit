## How to Contribute

We have multiple projects under the “Upblit”, and each project has its own set of issues. To make a meaningful contribution:-

### 1. Explore Projects and Issues
Before you start, please refer to the main README.md file of the Upblit repository. It lists all the projects and provides an overview. Each project repository will have its own dedicated [Issues](https://github.com/Debashismitra01/Upblit/issues) section.  

***Important for Hacktoberfest:-*** Look for issues specifically tagged with hacktoberfest. Only PRs addressing these tagged issues will be considered for your Hacktoberfest badge. While you are welcome to resolve other issues, they will not count towards the Hacktoberfest event.

---

### 2. Understand the Issue and Build an MVP
Once you've selected an issue (especially a hacktoberfest tagged one), take the time to thoroughly understand its requirements. For code contributions, focus on building a *Minimum Viable Product (MVP)* that addresses the core problem or implements the key feature described in the issue.

### 3. Documentation Contributions

We are in profound need of members who can help enhance our documentation. If you possess experience in backend, devops, java development, or server-architecture, your insights will be invaluable. You can contribute by:-

- Improving existing documentation to be clearer and more comprehensive.
- Writing new guides or tutorials that explain complex concepts or workflows.
- Providing practical examples of how to use different features of the Upblit.
- Creating explanations for the architecture principles.

### 4. Code Contributions

If you're interested in coding, we enthusiastically welcome contributions in the following areas:

- Bug Fixes: Identifying and resolving issues that hinder the project's functionality.
- Feature Enhancements: Adding new capabilities or improving existing ones.
- Code Optimization: Refactoring and improving the efficiency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.
- New Functionalities: Developing innovative features that expand the project's scope.

### 5. Auto Deployment System (Vercel-like)

We are building an **auto deployment system** , built primarily using **Java** and **Go**.  
This system aims to automate the end-to-end process of building, testing, and deploying fullstack applications seamlessly across environments.

If you're interested in contributing, you can help by:

- Enhancing the deployment pipeline and workflow automation.
- Building integrations for multiple frameworks and runtimes.
- Optimizing performance and scaling deployment services.
- Writing documentation or blogs explaining deployment architecture and design principles.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository:**  
Navigate to the specific project repository you wish to contribute to (e.g., Upblit). Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create your own copy of the project under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork:**  
Clone your forked repository to your local machine. Replace your-username with your GitHub username.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Upblit.git
```

3. **Create a Branch for Your Work:**  
Create a new branch for your specific contribution. It's good practice to name your branch related to the issue you're addressing (e.g., fix/bug-description or feat/new-feature-name).
```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

4. **Make Your Changes:**  
Implement your changes, focusing on the MVP for the chosen issue.

5. **Commit Your Changes:**  
Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message.
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Implement new feature for issue #XYZ"
```
(Replace "XYZ" with the actual issue number)

6. **Push Your Changes:**  
Push your local branch with your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
```bash
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

7. **Create a Pull Request (PR):**  
Go to the original elixpo_chapter/ElixpoAI-Art-Generator repository on GitHub. You will see an option to create a Pull Request from your recently pushed branch.  
* Crucially: Link your PR to the original issue it addresses (e.g., "Closes #XYZ" in your PR description).  
* Ensure your PR clearly explains the changes you've made and how they resolve the issue.
