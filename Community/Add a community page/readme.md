Community Page #19

This repository contains the source code for a complete, single-file community dashboard page. This page was created to address Issue #19: Make a community page.

The project is built as a single index.html file that includes all necessary HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality for a multi-section, responsive website.
